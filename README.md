# UFOs
## Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis is to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In additon to the date, users can filter for the city, state, country, and shape as well.

## Results
### 1. Welcome to UFO Sightings!

## Summary
### Drawback
The user must know specific dates, cities, or shapes to search. Some shapes like "light" might not be as intuitive. The filters require correct lower-case spellings and cannot include spaces at the end. The city that was used, for example, could not be typed as " bonita", or “bonita ”. The only acceptable input would be "bonita".
### Recommendations
1. A filter on a date range might be preferable than a singular date. Typing 1/2010 did not bring up all the dates from January as hoped. Perhaps, the UFO Sightings occur more frequently in a specific month instead of a specific day within the month. It is recommended to add in a filter function to include a date range as the filter to aid in the investigation of UFO Sightings.

2. The next addition to the filters should be to add a trim function to catch spaces at the frond or end of words as well as allow for upper and lower cases.
